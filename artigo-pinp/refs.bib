	abstract = {For pavement materials evaluation, it is common to treat laboratorial test data with classical statistical concepts, considering that a data set has a normal distribution, and therefore using the parameters average and standard deviation. The present work aims to verify if the normal distribution can be applied for the results of some tests, such as bulk specific gravity, apparent specific gravity and absorption for coarse aggregates, bulk specific gravity and air voids for hot mixture asphalt samples. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) e Shapiro-Wilk (S-W) tests were used with the SPSS. Each test was carried out at least 30 times by the same operator using the same equipment. There was convergence between the two normality tests for five of the six parameters. Then, the tests were also performed by nine different laboratories using similar samples; and only S-W test was used. These statistical analyses support the decision about the statistical tools used in the Interlaboratory Program of Aggregates and Asphalt Mixtures of the North-Northeast Asphalt Network.},

This work proposes to derive an airpassenger estimation model using three forms of gravity model and two machine learning approaches, regression and neural network. Data used in this work are Thailand’s domestic airpassengers and affecting factors on air-travel demand collected from publicly available sources. The results show that both regression and neural network with one hidden layer provide low error. Gross domestic product and number of tourists change in the same direction with air-passenger demand. The outcomes of this work give more understandings in employing machine learning to estimate air passengers in Thailand and can be developed for more complex forecast models in the future.},

	abstract = {Predicting human mobility within cities is an important task in urban and transportation planning. With the vast amount of digital traces available through social media platforms, we investigate the potential application of such data in predicting commuter trip distribution at small spatial scale. We develop back propagation (BP) neural network and gravity models using both traditional and Twitter data in New York City to explore their performance and compare the results. Our results suggest the potential of using social media data in transportation modeling to improve the prediction accuracy. Adding Twitter data to both models improved the performance with a slight decrease in root mean square error (RMSE) and an increase in R-squared (R2) value. The findings indicate that the traditional gravity models outperform neural networks in terms of having lower RMSE. However, the R2 results show higher values for neural networks suggesting a better fit between the real and predicted outputs. Given the complex nature of transportation networks and different reasons for limited performance of neural networks with the data, we conclude that more research is needed to explore the performance of such models with additional inputs.},

Here, these dynamics are modeled at a monthly scale to provide an open-access spatio-temporally resolved data source for research purposes (www.vbd-air.com/data). By reﬁning an annual-scale model of Huang et al. (2013), we developed a set of Poisson regression models to predict monthly passenger volumes between directly connected airports during 2010. The models not only performed well in the United States with an overall accuracy of 93\%, but also showed a reasonable conﬁdence in estimating air passenger volumes in other regions of the world. Using the model outcomes, this research studied the spatio-temporal dynamics in the world airline network (WAN) that previous analyses were unable to capture. Findings on the monthly variation of WAN offer new knowledge for dynamic planning and strategy design to address global issues, such as disease pandemics and climate change.},

The genetic algorithm parameters used in this study comprised population size (n): 200; the generation number: 1,000; and mutation rate: 0.01. The modelling results have shown that both the quadratic GAPAXDE and GARPKSDE models are more accurate, reliable, and have greater predictive capability as compared to the linear models.

However, the applicability of the model depends on the reliability of the results, which poses a major issue for researches. The major difficulty is to obtain comparable qualitative insights into the key parameters that are selected. This paper presents a possibility study for the use of the gravity model for regional route planning from the scientific point of view and suggests possibilities of gravity model calibration for airline network analysis including alternative methods for estimating the gravity potential of destinations and measurement of the influence of distance on the potential. The focus of the research is the ability to explain and forecast the development of regional air transportation routes in the commercial aviation network when there is a lack of recorded booking demand data.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal data, and more specifically origin–destination matrices, are critical inputs to mobility studies for transportation planning and urban management purposes. Traditionally, high-cost and hard-to-update household travel surveys are used to produce largescale origin–destination flow information of individuals’ whereabouts. In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate origin–destination (O–D) matrices based on passivelycollected cellular network signalling data of millions of anonymous mobile phone users in the Rhône-Alpes region, France. Unlike Call Detail Record (CDR) data which rely only on phone usage, signalling data include all network-based records providing higher spatiotemporal granularity. The explored dataset, which consists of time-stamped traces from 2G and 3G cellular networks with users’ unique identifier and cell tower locations, is used to first analyse the cell phone activity degree indicators of each user in order to qualify the mobility information involved in these records. These indicators serve as filtering criteria to identify users whose device transactions are sufficiently distributed over the analysed period to allow studying their mobility. Trips are then extracted from the spatiotemporal traces of users for whom the home location could be detected. Trips have been derived based on a minimum stationary time assumption that enables to determine activity (stop) zones for each user. As a large, but still partial, fraction of the population is observed, scaling is required to obtain an O–D matrix for the full population. We propose a method to perform this scaling and we show that signalling data-based O–D matrix carries similar estimations as those that can be obtained via travel surveys.},

In this paper, a divide-and-conquer method based on neural network and origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation is developed to forecast the short-term passenger flow in high-speed railway system. There are three steps in the forecasting method. Firstly, the numbers of passengers who arrive at each station or depart from each station are obtained from historical passenger flow data, which are OD matrices in this paper. Secondly, short-term passenger flow forecasting of the numbers of passengers who arrive at each station or depart from each station based on neural network is realized. At last, the OD matrices in short-term time are obtained with an OD matrix estimation method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed divide-and-conquer method performs well in forecasting the short-term passenger flow on high-speed railway.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the use of location information from cellular phones in estimating static origindestination (O-D) trip matrices. Cellular phones generate location data due to the communication technology used to function them. Data used in this paper were generated using the random number generator function in MS Excel, representing the IDs of communication cells (base station IDs) visited throughout the day by a set of cellular phone users to represent travelers in the city of UTOWN. The proposed model and data transfer algorithm were illustrated using the map of classic UTOWN divided into 20 cellular zones. Location data for 500 cellular phones assuming a sample of travelers over the city of UTOWN for 24 hours in an average workday were generated. The location information was generated in order to represent the location changes of the users in every 5 min. A simple computer code was written to transfer the location matrix (location information of cellular subscribers) to an O-D matrix based on the defined “origins” and “destinations.” The O-D matrix produced through this process needs adjustment in order to reflect the fact that not every traveler uses a cell phone in an ordinary city. The adjustment is based on the proportion of trip makers that are active cell phone subscribers and is used to convert the cellular O-D matrix to a trip matrix, which can then be used for travel demand modeling. The paper presents a sample of the synthetic location data, the flowchart of the computer code, and the output of the O-D matrix resulted.},

	abstract = {Automatic passenger flow estimation is very useful in public transportation system, which can improve the efficiency of public transportation service by optimizing the route plan and traffic scheduling. However, this task usually encounters many challenges in public transportation system, such as low resolution, background clutter, variation of illumination, pose and scale, etc. In this paper we propose a passenger counting system based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the spatio-temporal context (STC) model, where the CNN model is used to detect the passengers and the STC model is used to track the moving head of each passenger, respectively. Different from the traditional hand-engineered representation methods, our method uses CNN to automatically learn the related features of passengers. Meanwhile, target pre-location is used by combining the mixture of Gaussian (MoG) model and background subtraction, which can greatly reduce the following detection time. To address the tracking drift problem, inspired by the movement of ants in nature, we attempt to exploit the trajectory information to build a biologically inspired pheromone map and a 3D peak confidence map. Then, the number of passengers can be obtained by counting the regions of interest (ROI). Experimental results on an actual public bus transportation dataset show that this method outperforms some existing methods.},

Our method addresses how to handle the big data challenge as well as how one could plan to secure the privacy of the end users. The latter being one of the main reasons why carriers have not deployed anything similar yet. They have simply been too afraid of what would happen if the data would be mistreated or perceived as misused.},

	abstract = {Forecasting air passenger flows is receiving increasing attention, especially due to its intrinsic difficulties and wide applications. Total passengers are used as a proxy for air transport demand. However, the time series of air passenger flows usually has complicated behavior with high volatility and irregularity. This paper proposes a MIV-based nonlinear vector auto-regression neural network (NVARNN) approach to forecast air passenger flows. In the proposed MIV-NVARNN learning approach, (1) a method of mean impact value (MIV) based on neural network is used for identifying and extracting input variables; (2) NVARNN is firstly proposed to deal with the irregularity and volatility of the time series of air passenger flows. To illustrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we tested its directional and level forecasting accuracy using the time series of Beijing International Airport's passenger flows. The results of out-of-sample forecasting performance show that the proposed MIV-NVARNN approach consistently outperforms single models and other hybrid approaches in terms of level forecasting accuracy, directional forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis.},

We find that a composite variable made up by the airport capacity variables – given by the size of the terminal building and the length of runways – and its domestic connections have a positive effect on airport competi­ tiveness. In conclusion, we find that not only well-known demand-side factors, but also supply-side variables –strategic decisions taken by airport management – matter in attracting international flights.},

Both problematic issues, recently addressed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro in an influential paper, are re-examined here. We use Monte Carlo simulations to compare the Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator recommended by Santos Silva and Tenreyro, a Gamma pseudo-maximum-likelihood (GPML), a Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) estimator and a Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) estimator with more traditional techniques. Additionally, estimates of the gravity equation are obtained for three different data sets with the abovementioned methods. The results of the simulation study indicate that, although the PPML estimator is less affected by heteroskedasticity than others are, its performance is similar, in terms of bias and standard errors, to the FGLS estimator performance, in particular for small samples. GPML presents however the lowest bias and standard errors in the simulations without zero values. The results of the empirical estimations, using three different samples containing real data, indicate that the choice of estimator has to be made for each specific dataset. There is not a general “best” estimator and it is highly recommended to follow a model selection approach using a number of tests to select the more appropriate estimator for any application.},

We have also provided an empirical analysis of Czech and German panel data sets based on the comparison of the performance of traditional and Poisson estimation approaches. This analysis confirms Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood estimation method as a more proper method for estimating the coefficients of the gravity equation.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, ﬂying has become increasingly accessible and the global aviation industry is growing rapidly. This causes airports and airspaces to reach their capacity limits. Reliable estimation and forecasting of air passenger demand is very important for airlines in order to allocate resources effectively in a constrained and competitive aviation environment. A model is developed to estimate air passenger demand suitable for routes where currently no direct service exists in order to aid decision-making on new destinations. For this model the traditional gravity model is extended with big data from worldwide ﬂight search engines (meta search data). The model is applied to a case study with real world data from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. We ﬁnd that the gravity model enriched with meta search data is able to accurately predict demand and rank destinations that are currently not connected to KLM’s network by a direct ﬂight. The data-driven approach allows us to give recommendations about promising destinations that could be added to an airline’s network. Ultimately, a more efﬁcient network as a result of advanced demand estimation is expected to lead to higher load factors and lower emissions per passenger.},
