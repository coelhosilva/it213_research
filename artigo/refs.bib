	abstract = {This paper presents two gravity models for the estimation of air passenger volume between city-pairs. The models include variables describing the general economic activity and geographical characteristics of city-pairs instead of variables describing air service characteristics. Thus, both models can be applied to city-pairs where currently no air service is established, historical data is not available, or for which factors describing the current service level of air transportation are not accessible or accurately predictable. One model is limited to city-pairs with airports not subject to competition from airports in the vicinity, while the other model includes all city-pairs. Booking data of ﬂights between Germany and 28 European countries is used for calibration. Both models show a good ﬁt to the observed data and are statistically tested and validated.},

	abstract = {Abstract: the gravity model is a method that is used by transportation researchers, airline network planners and analysts to explain how traffic is distributed between city pairs in correlation to the distance or travelling time between them, which as a result indicates the behaviour of travellers or the performance of the transport connection. However, the applicability of the model depends on the reliability of the results, which poses a major issue for researches. The major difficulty is to obtain comparable qualitative insights into the key parameters that are selected. This paper presents a possibility study for the use of the gravity model for regional route planning from the scientific point of view and suggests possibilities of gravity model calibration for airline network analysis including alternative methods for estimating the gravity potential of destinations and measurement of the influence of distance on the potential. The focus of the research is the ability to explain and forecast the development of regional air transportation routes in the commercial aviation network when there is a lack of recorded booking demand data.},

	abstract = {Predicting human mobility within cities is an important task in urban and transportation planning. With the vast amount of digital traces available through social media platforms, we investigate the potential application of such data in predicting commuter trip distribution at small spatial scale. We develop back propagation (BP) neural network and gravity models using both traditional and Twitter data in New York City to explore their performance and compare the results. Our results suggest the potential of using social media data in transportation modeling to improve the prediction accuracy. Adding Twitter data to both models improved the performance with a slight decrease in root mean square error (RMSE) and an increase in R-squared (R2) value. The findings indicate that the traditional gravity models outperform neural networks in terms of having lower RMSE. However, the R2 results show higher values for neural networks suggesting a better fit between the real and predicted outputs. Given the complex nature of transportation networks and different reasons for limited performance of neural networks with the data, we conclude that more research is needed to explore the performance of such models with additional inputs.},

	abstract = {Air passenger estimation is essential since air-travel demand continuously grows. This work proposes to derive an airpassenger estimation model using three forms of gravity model and two machine learning approaches, regression and neural network. Data used in this work are Thailand’s domestic airpassengers and affecting factors on air-travel demand collected from publicly available sources. The results show that both regression and neural network with one hidden layer provide low error. Gross domestic product and number of tourists change in the same direction with air-passenger demand. The outcomes of this work give more understandings in employing machine learning to estimate air passengers in Thailand and can be developed for more complex forecast models in the future.},
